### What is the layering order and what are the effects?  
It is the appearance and behavior of tiles, when two different types of tile are placed on adjacent positions.  

*Red layering above:*

*Red layering below:*

*Red merging:*  
![red-merge](https://github.com/0n0w1c/Foundations/blob/main/graphics/faq/red-merge.png?raw=true)  

This is the layering order the startup settings adjusts, tiles with higher numbers layer on top of tiles with lower numbers.  
Tiles set to the same layering order merge.  

*Hazard and Dectorio's Safety Refined concrete are set to the same layering order as Refined concrete.*  

### What are excluded entities?  
There are two categories of excluded entities.  

*Entities that never have tiles automatically placed under them:*  
>   vehicles  
>   ghost entities  
>   locomotives, wagons, rails, and rail signals  
>   mining-drills  
>   offshore-pumps  
>   spidertrons  
>   trees

*Entities for which automatic tile placement is runtime selectable:*  
>   belts, underground belts, splitters, and loaders  
>   inserters  
>   small and medium electric poles

*The runtime selectable entities play a significant role in the tile layering pattern.*
