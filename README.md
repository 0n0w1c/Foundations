####Warning: Do not remove the foundation before deconstructing the factory entities.  
####If you mine the foundation from underneeth an entity, it will be destroyed.  

Stone furnaces (foundation required with IR3), pumps, pipes, belts, gun turrets, and small/medium power poles are excluded.  
However, factory entities require a foundation. Stone bricks work fine, so the cost is not so great.  
Your factory will look better, you will travel faster, and somehow it just seems natural.  
It increases the pleasure I get from the game, I hope it does the same for you.  

Safe to add to an existing save, will not disturb what you have previously built. Only applies to new construction.
