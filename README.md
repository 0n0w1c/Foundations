Note: Starting with version 0.0.8, burner entities now require a foundation. This includes the vanilla burner inserter.  

Stone furnaces (foundation required with IR3), pumps, pipes, belts, gun turrets, and small/medium power poles are excluded.  
However, factory entities require a foundation. Stone bricks work fine, so the cost is not so great.  
Your factory will look better, you will travel faster, and somehow it just seems natural.  
It increases the pleasure I get from the game, I hope it does the same for you.  

Safe to add to an existing save, will not disturb what you have previously built. Only applies to new construction.

Known issues:  
Blueprints that include both tiles and entities that require a foundation.  
Build a foundation first, then apply the blueprint.  

Limitations:  
Stone furnaces are not upgradable via the upgrade planner (except with IR3).  
Probably does not work well with mods that provide multiple surfaces.
