#### A Quality of Life mod to help engineers quickly and easily build a more interesting factory.  
There are no special bonuses with this mod, it is decorative and helpful in nature.  

#### New feature: Added three more selection tools for en masse tile operations.  
A quick [demo](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-Q80DSgyIuHM7wrxrbzyDSqme0gMSsAz/view?usp=drive_link) showing some of the selection tools in action.

With the Foundations button, you can disable the placement of foundation tiles or select the tile of your choice.  
You can also enable the available selection based tools by:  
*[ctrl]+[left-click]* (Fill tool) - place tiles on open positions  
*[shift]+[left-click]* (Unfill tool) - remove tiles from open positions  
*[ctrl]+[right-click]* (Place tool) - place foundation tiles under entities  
*[shift]+[right-click]* (Unplace tool) - remove foundation tiles from under entities  

Startup setting to select the tile mining time (default = 0.1).  
Startup setting to clean sweep (remove ground decorations), when tiles are placed.  
Startup setting for the number of rows to add to the player inventory size.

Startup settings to change the stacking order, higher numbers stack on lower numbers.  
Tiles assigned with the same number, merge rather than stack.  
If Alien Biomes is active, settings for stacking the painted refined concretes are not available.  
If Dectorio is active, this mod will utilize the provided painted refined concrete.  
Otherwise, if the startup setting is enabled, this mod will supply the painted refined concrete.  

A runtime setting for each tile, allows you to limit the selections available for the Foundations button,  
to create a "palatte" of tiles for quick selection.  
Dectorio users should visit the runtime settings (Map tab), most of the Dectorio tiles are not selected by default.  

Runtime settings to exclude small/medium electric poles, inserters, and belts, splitters, and loaders.  

Settings for the various supported mods are only visible when the supported mod is active.  

Attempts to build without the required number of foundation tiles in the player inventory, will be halted.  
Make sure to have enough of the selected foundation tiles in your inventory, or disable foundation tile placement.  

Foundations is compatible with personal logistics for construction and deconstruction.  

#### Limitations:  
Tiles placed or removed with the selection tools are not "Undo"-able, use them with some caution.  
Not compatible with multi-player mode, single-player mode only.
