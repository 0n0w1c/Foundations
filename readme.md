With the Foundations button, you can disable the placement of foundation tiles or select the tile of your choice.  
To activate the fill tool, *[ctrl]+[left-mouse-click]* on the Foundations button, with a foundation tile selected.  

A runtime setting for each tile, allows you to limit the selections to create a "palatte" of tiles, for quick selection.  
Dectorio users should visit the runtime settings (map tab), most of the Dectorio tiles are not selected by default.  
Settings for the various supported mods are only visible when the supported mod is active.  
These settings do not alter the tiles the player has available, only if they are to be included in the button "palette".  

A runtime setting to select whether the foundation tiles are to be mined or not, when an entity is mined.  
There are also runtime settings to exclude small/medium electric poles, inserters, and belts, splitters, and loaders.  

Attempts to build, without the required number of foundation tiles in the player inventory, will be halted.  
Make sure to have enough of the selected foundation tiles in your inventory, or disable foundation tile placement.  

Runtime setting to clean sweep (remove ground decorations), when the foundation tiles are placed.  

Mining times for all minable tiles are standardized to that of refined concrete.  

Users have a startup setting to enable and configure the stacking of painted refined concrete.  
If Alien Biomes is active, settings for stacking the painted refined conretes are not available.  
If Dectorio is active, this mod will utilize the provided painted refined concrete.  
Otherwise, this mod now supplies the painted refined concretes.  

Foundations is compatible with personal logistics for construction and deconstruction.  

#### Limitations:  
Tiles placed with the fill tool are not "Undo"-able, use with caution.  
Not compatible with multi-player mode, single-player mode only.
