Warning: Do not remove the foundation before deconstructing the factory entities.  

If you mine the foundation from underneath an entity, the entity will not be returned to your inventory, rather it will be erased from the game.  
I highly recommend installing [Simple Landfill Mining](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/simple_landfill_mining), to prevent the mining of the foundation from underneath entities. Make sure to enable the startup setting "Recover mined landfill", if you want the foundation to be returned to your inventory. 

Pumps, pipes, belts, splitters, rails, and small/medium power poles are excluded, stone furnaces and gun turrets are optional. Other factory entities require a foundation. Stone bricks work fine, so the cost is not too great.  
Your factory will look better, you will travel faster, and somehow it just seems natural.    

Safe to add to an existing save, will not disturb what you have previously built. Only applies to new construction.

Known issues:  
Mining the foundation from underneath an entity, destroys the entity ([not a bug](https://forums.factorio.com/viewtopic.php?f=23&t=77571)).  
Mine the entities first, then the foundation.  

Blueprints that include both tiles and entities that require a foundation.  
Build a foundation first, then apply the blueprint.  

Limitations:  
If the startup setting "Foundation required for stone furnaces" is disabled, stone furnaces will not be upgradable via the upgrade planner.  
May not be compatible with mods that construct factory entities on character creation (cut scenes), unless support has been added.
