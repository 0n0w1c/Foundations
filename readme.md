Now inhibits the mining of foundation tiles from underneath factory entities that require a foundation!

Pumps, pipes, belts, splitters, rails, and small/medium power poles are excluded, stone furnaces and gun turrets are optional. Other factory entities require a foundation. Stone bricks work fine, so the cost is not too great.  
Your factory will look better, you will travel faster, and somehow it just seems natural.    

Safe to add to an existing save, will not disturb what you have previously built. Only applies to new construction.

Known issues:  
Blueprints that include both tiles and entities that require a foundation.  
Build a foundation first, then apply the blueprint.  

Limitations:  
If the startup setting "Foundation required for stone furnaces" is disabled, stone furnaces will not be upgradable via the upgrade planner.  
May not be compatible with mods that construct factory entities upon character creation (cut scenes), unless support has been added.
