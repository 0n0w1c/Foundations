With the Foundations button, you can disable the placement of foundation tiles or select the tile of your choice.  
To activate the Foundation fill tool, ctrl-left-mouse-click on the Foundations button, while a foundation is selected.  

A runtime setting for each tile, allows you to limit the selections to create a "palatte" of tiles, for quick selection.  
Dectorio users should visit the runtime settings (map tab), most of the Dectorio tiles are not selected by default.  
Settings for the various supported mods are only visible when the supported mod is active.  
These settings do not alter the tiles the player has available, only if they are to be included in the button "palette".  

A runtime setting to select if the foundation tiles are to be mined, when an entity is mined.  
There are also runtime settings to exclude small/medium electric poles, inserters, and belts, splitters, and loaders.  

Attempts to build, without the required number of foundation tiles in the player inventory, will come to a halt.  
Make sure to have enough of the selected foundation tiles in your inventory, or disable foundation tile placement.  

Foundations is compatible with personal logistics for construction, for deconstruction they behave as normal.
